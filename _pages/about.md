Hello! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Ingenuity Labs at Queenâ€™s University. Prior to Ph.D. study, I worked on bio-sensor design for Peking University People's hospital under the supervision of [Yi Feng, M.D](https://english.pkuph.cn/html/care/departments/medica/Pain_Medicine/324.html) and [Yaoxue Zhang, Ph.D](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4004.htm). Before that, I have been work on muscle faigue detection under supervision of [Eveln Morin](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/E-L-Morin/index.html) and earned my master degree. During my bachelor, I have been mostly working on power electronics and microelectronics.I expect to graduate in December, 2022.
