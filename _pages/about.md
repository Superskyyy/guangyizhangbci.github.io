Hello! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Ingenuity Labs Research Institute at Queenâ€™s University (Kingston, Canada). Prior to beginning my Ph.D. study, I worked on bio-sensor design for detection of palinesthesia status after anaesthesia care for infant patients, at Peking University People's Hospital in Beijing, China, under the supervision of [Yi Feng, M.D.](https://english.pkuph.cn/html/care/departments/medica/Pain_Medicine/324.html) and [Prof. Yaoxue Zhang, Ph.D.](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4004.htm). Prior to that, I worked on bio-signals processing for muscle faigue detection under supervision of [Prof. Eveln Morin, Ph.D.](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/E-L-Morin/index.html) and received my master degree. Throughout my undergraduate study, I mostly focused on power electronics and microelectronics. I expect to graduate in **December, 2022**.

It is my honour to work under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Etemad, Ph.D.](https://www.aiimlab.com/director). My current research interests lie in the area of electroencephalography, brain computer interface (BCI), deep learning, semi-supervised learning and riemannian geometry. During the first 3 years of my PhD research, I **first authored** 8 papers (5 accepted, 3 journal submissions under review at IEEE Transactions) with more than 100 citations. For more publication information, please visit my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ITguoVwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
I have also been a reviewer of top-tier AI and EEG venues such as IEEE **T-PAMI**, IEEE T-Cyb, IEEE **T-NSRE**, IEEE T-AI, Pattern Recognit. (Elsevier), ICPR, ACII, SMC and AAAI workshop. 

I am very interested in human-centric AI with neuroscience and deep learning. My long-term research goal is to build a simpler, faster, and more accutate wearable BCI!
