Hello! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Ingenuity Labs at Queenâ€™s University. Prior to Ph.D. study, I worked on bio-sensor design for Peking University People's hospital under the supervision of [Yi Feng, M.D.](https://english.pkuph.cn/html/care/departments/medica/Pain_Medicine/324.html) and [Prof. Yaoxue Zhang, Ph.D.](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4004.htm). Before that, I have been work on muscle faigue detection under supervision of [Prof. Eveln Morin, Ph.D.](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/E-L-Morin/index.html) and earned my master degree. During my bachelor, I have been mostly working on power electronics and microelectronics. I expect to graduate in December, 2022.

I am very glad to work under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Etemad, Ph.D.](https://www.aiimlab.com/director). My current research interests lie in the area of Electroencephalography, brain computer interface (BCI), deep learning, semi-supervised learning and riemannian geometry.  
My long-term research goal is to work in neuroscience, building a simpler, faster, and more accutate BCI system using AI!
