Hello! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Ingenuity Labs Research Institute at Queenâ€™s University (Kingston, Canada). Prior to beginning my Ph.D. study, I worked on bio-sensor design for detection of palinesthesia status after anaesthesia care for infant patients, at Peking University People's Hospital in Beijing, China, under the supervision of [Yi Feng, M.D.](https://english.pkuph.cn/html/care/departments/medica/Pain_Medicine/324.html). At the same time, I was also a researcher in Transparent Computing Lab, supervised by [Prof. Yaoxue Zhang, Ph.D.](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4004.htm). Prior to that, I worked on bio-signals processing for muscle faigue detection under supervision of [Prof. Eveln Morin, Ph.D.](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/E-L-Morin/index.html) and received my master degree. Throughout my undergraduate study, I mostly focused on power electronics and microelectronics. I expect to graduate in **December, 2022**.

It is my great honour to work under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Etemad, Ph.D.](https://www.aiimlab.com/director). My current research interests lie in the area of electroencephalography, brain computer interface (BCI), deep learning, semi-supervised learning and riemannian geometry. During the first 3 years of my PhD research, I **first authored** 8 papers (6 accepted, 2 journal submissions under review at IEEE Transactions) with more than 100 citations. For more publication information, please visit my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ITguoVwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
I have also been a reviewer of top-tier AI and BCI venues such as IEEE-**TPAMI**, IEEE-TCYB, **IEEE-TAFFC**, IEEE-**TNSRE**, IEEE-TAI, Pattern Recognit. (Elsevier), ICPR, ACII, SMC and AAAI workshop. 

<!-- Starting from **Jan, 2023**, I will join University of Toronto ([Top 5 in the world in Oncology](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/oncology)) as a postdoctoral reseacher working on genetics with deep learning at [Princess Margaret Cancer Research Center](https://www.uhnresearch.ca/institutes/pm) under the joint supervision of [Prof. Bo Wang, Ph.D.](https://wanglab.ml/) (CS, Stanford) and [Prof. Hansen He, Ph.D.](http://www.hansenhelab.org/) (Medicine, Harvard). -->
