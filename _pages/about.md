Hello! I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the **University of Toronto** ([top 5 in the world for oncology](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/oncology)). I will work on AI for medial applications, particularly cancer research, at [Princess Margaret Cancer Research Center(https://www.uhnresearch.ca/institutes/pm) under the joint supervision of [Prof. Bo Wang, Ph.D.](https://wanglab.ml/) (Computer Science, Stanford) and [Prof. Hansen He, Ph.D.](http://www.hansenhelab.org/) (Medicine, Harvard).


I completed my PhD program in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Queenâ€™s University**. It has been my great honour to work under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Etemad](https://www.aiimlab.com/director). My previous research interests lie in the area of electroencephalography, brain computer interface (BCI), deep learning, affective computing, and semi-supervised learning. During the first 3 years of my PhD research, I **first authored** 8 papers (6 accepted, 2 journal submissions under review at IEEE Transactions) with near 200 citations. For more publication information, please visit my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ITguoVwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
I have also been a reviewer of top-tier AI and BCI venues such as **IEEE-TPAMI**, IEEE-TCYB, **IEEE-TAFFC**, **IEEE-TNNLS**, **IEEE-TNSRE**, IEEE-TAI, Pattern Recognit. (Elsevier), ICPR, ACII, SMC and an area chair of AAAI workshop. 

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. study, I worked on bio-sensor design for detection of palinesthesia status after anaesthesia care for infant patients, at **Peking University People's Hospital** in Beijing, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Yi Feng](https://english.pkuph.cn/html/care/departments/medica/Pain_Medicine/324.html). At the same time, I was also a researcher in Transparent Computing Lab, supervised by [Prof. Yaoxue Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4004.htm). Prior to that, I worked on bio-signals processing for muscle faigue detection under supervision of [Prof. Eveln Morin](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/E-L-Morin/index.html) and received my master degree. Throughout my undergraduate study, I mostly focused on power electronics and microelectronics.
